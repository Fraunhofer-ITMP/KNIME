# **KNIME**

Here some **KNIME** workflows have been collected. Main topic are High Content Screening and High-Throughput Screening analysis.

1) **"Dose Response Curve"** KNIME workflow can help for curve fitting of experimental screening. Input table is in Data/ as exemplification but in principle a CSV and/or an Excel table can be implemented as well.

**KNIME** can be freely downloaded [here](https://www.knime.com/downloads). Registration can be redone every time but to install first time it is better to inform local IT to let them install (for Fraunhofer colleagues, especially).

Importing the Workflow can be directly done from within KNIME or from a web browser using following link: (https://kni.me/s/3h_HklIp97D7uJdg)
